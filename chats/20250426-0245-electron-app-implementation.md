**End Time**: 2025-04-26 03:06:26

## Summary of Work Done

In this chat session, we successfully implemented an Electron application wrapper for the existing Jira Timesheet Free web application. This allows users to install and run the application as a native desktop application without having to manually start a Python server.

### Key Files Created/Modified:

1. **Electron Framework**:
   - `electron/main.js` - Main Electron process
   - `electron/preload.js` - Security bridge between Electron and web content
   - `package.json` - Node.js dependencies and Electron build configuration
   - Added application icons in `electron/icons/` directory

2. **Python Server**:
   - Refactored `server.py` to be a self-contained implementation
   - Added command-line arguments support
   - Improved error handling and file path resolution

3. **Helper Scripts**:
   - `start-app.js` - Utility script to launch the app in either web or Electron mode
   - Updated `.gitignore` to handle Electron build artifacts

4. **Documentation**:
   - Updated `README.md` to feature the Electron app as the primary installation method
   - Added download links and installation instructions

### Application Features:

- Cross-platform desktop application (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Embedded Python server for Jira API communication
- Same functionality as the web version
- Native desktop integration
- Single-click launch experience
- Clean installer with customizable installation path

### Build Output:

- Successfully built Windows installer: `Jira Timesheet Free-Setup-1.0.0.exe`
- Setup proper build configuration for macOS and Linux (to be built on those platforms)

## TO DO

1. **Cross-platform Testing**:
   - Test on macOS and Linux platforms
   - Build installers for those platforms

2. **Distribution**:
   - Create GitHub releases with the built installers
   - Update download links in README with actual release URLs

3. **Enhancements**:
   - Implement auto-updates
   - Add more desktop integration features (notifications, system tray)
   - Consider packaging Python with PyInstaller for more efficient distribution

4. **Documentation**:
   - Create detailed documentation on how to build from source
   - Add troubleshooting section

The project now offers a complete solution for users who want either a desktop application experience or the original web-based approach, making it more accessible to a wider audience.
