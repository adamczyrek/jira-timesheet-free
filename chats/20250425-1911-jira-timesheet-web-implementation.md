# Jira Timesheet Free Web Implementation

**Start Time:** 2025-04-25 17:19:48Z  
**End Time:** 2025-04-25 19:11:09Z

## Summary

In this session, we created a web-based version of the Jira timesheet generator bash script, which we previously created. The application allows users to generate detailed worklog reports from Jira by connecting to the Jira API through a local proxy server. The implementation includes a clean, responsive UI with both light and dark theme support, comprehensive error handling, and user-friendly features like automatic account ID lookup.

## Modified Files

### Created Files
- `static/index.html` - Main HTML interface with form inputs and results display
- `static/styles.css` - CSS styling with theme support (light/dark mode)
- `static/script.js` - JavaScript code for UI interaction and API communication
- `server.py` - Python proxy server to handle CORS and secure API communication
- `LICENSE` - MIT license file
- `README.md` - Documentation with setup and usage instructions
- `.gitignore` - Standard gitignore file for Python projects
- `app-summary.md` - Detailed application summary
